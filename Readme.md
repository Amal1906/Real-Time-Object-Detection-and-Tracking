# Real-Time Object Detection and Tracking with YOLOv8

## Overview
This project demonstrates how to use the **YOLOv8 Nano** model to perform **real-time object detection and tracking** using a webcam. The system identifies objects in a live video stream, tracks their presence, and logs when objects appear or disappear from the frame.

## Objective
To build a lightweight object detection and tracking system that:
- Uses the YOLOv8 Nano model for fast inference on CPU
- Tracks objects using unique IDs
- Displays real-time annotated video with bounding boxes
- Logs new and missing objects between frames

## Output
The output.mp4 tracks the object and the green signal indicate the object is being detected and then the red signal indicate the specific object that has a unique ID is removed from the frame.
